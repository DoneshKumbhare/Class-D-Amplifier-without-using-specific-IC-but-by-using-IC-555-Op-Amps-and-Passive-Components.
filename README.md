Simulation of a Class D audio amplifier designed in Proteus 8 using a 555 Timer, Op-Amp, and passive components. The project demonstrates PWM generation, MOSFET switching, and output waveform observation on a virtual oscilloscope, emphasizing component-level circuit design and signal analysis.

Overview
This project demonstrates the design and simulation of a Class D audio amplifier in Proteus 8. Unlike traditional amplifier designs that rely on specialized ICs, this project uses fundamental components: a 555 Timer, an Op-Amp (LM386/LM393), MOSFETs (IRFZ44N), and passive components. The output is observed on a virtual oscilloscope to study waveform behavior.
The project highlights PWM generation, switching control, and audio signal amplification in a digital amplifier topology, providing hands-on understanding of signal processing at the hardware level.
